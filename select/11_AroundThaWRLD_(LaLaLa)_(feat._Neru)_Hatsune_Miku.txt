The kisses of the sun
So sweet I couldn't think
Light up in my eyes Like an exotic drink
M Radio playin' songs I never upped before
I Don't know what to say
Oh not another way
Just la-la
It goes around the world
Just la-la-la-la-la
It's all around the world
La-la-la-la-la
Now the harmony's playin
And now the bells are ringin
(Yuh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh)
Ahhhh!

Ya'll know the vibes
Let's get it let's get it let's get it (Look)
Spin through gotta stay with my grip (with my grip)
They know my bop I get lit (I get lit)
I'm too tough when I spin through that strip
If he run up on me he get hit where he is
Word to bro I ain't beefin' with kids
And why am I hearing my name in yo' diss tracks?
Don't wanna hear no more nigga get back!
Why niggas dissin' on me and they think that they tough?
You is just cappin' boy you a bluff
Stay in school nigga get off that snuff
I'm with Miku and Neru this shit gettin' tough
They like rDottyB why you doin' too much?
I'm eatin' up pussy I'm eatin' up lunch
Ain't no time for you nigga you gotta crunch
Stack up this money I stack a whole bunch
You know how I do it I stack a lot
You be stayin' at home and you snack a lot
You know my motto you know I move tact a lot
She tried to line me now I'm playin' pack-a-thot
She think she tough she just act-a-thot
Punchin' my chest you know I'm Celine boppin' (Celine!)
I'm on the grind 'till I come up ain't no stoppin
I'm takin' off like a rocket
Miku got the rocket in her pocket!
We on the beat start hoppin
Slide to the left to the right now we cris-crossin
Pull a rabbit out my hat just watch this
If you see Miku you gotta move cautious
I'm way too high you know I'm feelin' nauseous
Biohazard synth got me toxic
Nigga why you always pocket watchin
Stackin' this money they say I got moxie
Hidin' from the sun I be up late at night
You know that I'm the one they be afraid to fight
You know I got my gun I be clickin
I be clickin' till I'm done clickin clickin It be like
La-la-la-la-la
